Reactive Js is a static music player written in React. SCSS preprocessors have been deeply implemented in this player.
The number of songs available for playing is limited due to time boundation I had to create a REST API for serving music links. 

* **Why Reactive:** Can be used to play music instantly, high quality music.
* **Ambient environment:** SCSS preprocessors have been used to make a vibrant ambience.
* **Low internet usage:** The internet usage by the web app is comparatively lower than other web players available due to choice of song links.
* **Clean UI:** Visit the web app once, you're gonna love it <3.
